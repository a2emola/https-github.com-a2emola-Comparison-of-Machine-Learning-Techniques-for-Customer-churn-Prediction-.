Comparison-of-Machine-Learning-Techniques-for-Customer-churn-Prediction-.

Customer churn prediction models aim to detect customers with a high propensity to attrite. it is no secret that customer retention is a top priority for many companies; acquiring new customers can be several times more expensive than retaining existing ones

This project tries to compare and analyze the performance of different machine-learning techniques that are used for churn prediction problem. Four analytical techniques that belong to different categories of learning are chosen for this study. Models were applied on a dataset that contains 10000 customer records.
This project constitutes a comparison of five of the mostly used classification methods on the problem of customers churning in the banking system. 
In particular, we compare our dataset based on the performance of the following methods/algorithms: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and logistic Regression classifiers. 
This investigation is performed using Monte Carlo simulation at different settings for each classification method. 
The churn dataset are originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

Results shows that Support Vector machine can be recommended as it outpowers all other techniques
